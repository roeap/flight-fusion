# flight-fusion

[![CI](https://github.com/roeap/flight-fusion/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/roeap/flight-fusion/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

This repository contains some experiments on what a modern data platform could look like.
A strong emphasis lies on how observability can be achieved throughout all actions
occurring on a data platform.

## Documentation

Currently the documentation is not published, but can be viewed in this repository.

```sh
mkdocs serve
```

## Development

To run unit tests for the rust crates execute

```sh
cargo test
```

To build and install the python bindings run

```sh
make python-develop
```

### Build Docker

```sh
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile
```

### Generating python protos

To generate proto definitions for use in python client.

```
make proto
```

Afterwards imports in the generated `message_pb2.py` and `message_pb2.pyi` have to be fixed manually.

## Known issues

Right now the current release of the `quote` crate breaks the build. Until the dependent crates have addressed
the underlying issue, the version of the quote crate has to be manually pinned.

```sh
cargo update --package quote --precise 1.0.10
```
