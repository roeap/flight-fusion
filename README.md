This repository contains some experiments on what a modern data platform could look like.
A strong emphasis lies on how observability can be achieved throughout all actions
occurring on a data platform.

## Documentation

Currently the documentation is not published, but can be viewed in this repository.

```sh
mkdocs serve
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- rust>=1.57
- poetry (for python development)

### Rust

To run unit tests for the rust crates execute

```sh
cargo test
```

To build crates and services

```sh
cargo build
```

TODO explain mock framework

## Python Development

To set up the python environment run

```sh
poetry install
```

The python bindings for rust dependent crates have to be build and installed separately.
Make sure you have the environment created by poetry activated and run.

```sh
make python-develop
```

## Dagster

To see the Dagster integrations in play, create two folders in the project root: `.dagster` and `.fusion`,
then start an instance of the fusion service in a separate shell.

```sh
fusion server start --host 127.0.0.1 --port 50051 --log-level info
```

An example Dagster repository using most of the features from the `dagster-fusion` package is
provided within `scripts/dagster_example.py`. To inspect it and play with the configurations,
run a local instance of dagster.

```sh
DAGSTER_HOME=$(pwd)/.dagster dagit -f scripts/dagster_example.py
```

## Build Docker

```sh
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile
```

```sh
docker run -d -p6831:6831/udp -p6832:6832/udp -p16686:16686 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
```

### Generating python protos

To generate proto definitions for use in python client.

```
make python-proto
```
