        Client certificate if using mutual TLS

        Client private key for cert_chain is using mutual TLS
    override_hostname : str or None
        Override the hostname checked by TLS. Insecure, use with caution.
    middleware : list optional, default None
        A list of ClientMiddlewareFactory instances.
    write_size_limit_bytes : int optional, default None
        A soft limit on the size of a data payload sent to the

        batch that (when serialized) exceeds this limit will raise an

        batch.
    disable_server_verification : boolean optional, default False
        A flag that indicates that, if the client is connecting
        with TLS, that it skips server verification. If this is
        enabled, all other TLS settings are overridden.
    generic_options : list optional, default None
        A list of generic (string, int or string) option tuples passed
