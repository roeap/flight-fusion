//! # Authenticates Azure JWT tokens.
//!
//! This library will fetch public keys from Microsoft and use those keys to validate the
//! authenticity of a token you provide. It defaults to validating and mapping Azure Id tokens for
//! you out of the box, but should work with other tokens as well if you use a custom validator.
//!
//! It uses `request` with the "blocking" feature to fetch metadata and public
//! keys, but used correctly it will only update these once a day.
//!
//! # Dafault validation
//!
//! **There are mainly six conditions a well formed token will need to meet to be validated:**
//! 1. That the token is issued by Azure and is not tampered with
//! 2. That this token is issued for use in your application
//! 3. That the token is not expired
//! 4. That the token is not used before it's valid
//! 5. That the token is not issued in the future
//! 6. That the algorithm in the token header is the same as we use*
//!
//! * Note that we do NOT use the token header to set the algorithm for us, look [at this article
//! for more information on why that would be bad](https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/)
//!
//! The validation will `Error` on a failed validation providing more granularity for library users
//! to find out why the token was rejected.
//!
//! If the token is invalid it will return an Error instead of a boolean. The main reason for this
//! is easier logging of what type of test it failed.
//!
//! You also have a `validate_custom` mathod which gives you full control over the mapping of the token
//! fields and more control over the validation.
//!
//! # Security
//! You will need a private app_id created by Azure for your application to be able to veriify that
//! the token is created for your application (and not anyone with a valid Azure token can log in)
//! and you will need to authenticate that the user has the right access to your system.
//!
//! For more information, see this artice: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens
//!
//! # Example in webserver
//!
//! ```rust, ignore
//! struct AppState {
//!     azure_auth: auth::AzureAuth,
//! }
//!
//! pub fn start_web_server(port: &str) -> Result<(), Error> {
//!
//!     // since this calls windows api, wrap in Arc<Mutex<_>> and share the validator
//!     let app_state = Arc::new(Mutex::new(AppState {
//!         azure_auth: auth::AzureAuth::new("32166c25-5e31-4cfc-a29b-04d0dfdb019a").unwrap(),
//!     }));
//!     println!("Starting web server on: http://localhost:8000");
//!
//!     server::new(move || app(app_state.clone())).bind(port)?.run();
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```

/// - Hashing algorithm: Sha256, you can't change this setting. Submit an issue in the github repo
